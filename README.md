map_editor
==========

This is very early version of map editor. Tool that will allow editing SVG maps and convert them into bitmap format.

There will be two types of map coloring:
* explicit coloring (interactive)
* implicit coloring (based on some data set)

At this moment it is only possible to do first type of coloring, and UI for this is still not complete.
